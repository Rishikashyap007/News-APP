# News App

## Overview

This is a responsive news web application that utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to fetch and display top headlines from the News API. Users can view the latest news on the website's initial load and also search for news based on their interests.

## Features

- **Top Headlines on Page Load:** The website automatically displays top headlines related to a default query (e.g., top headlines from India) when the page loads.

- **Search Functionality:** Users can input their own queries in the search bar, triggering a request to the News API for relevant news articles. The search results replace the default top headlines.

- **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
